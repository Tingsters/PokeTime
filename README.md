This is the list of hardware you will need for the kids workshop. Some of the components (like the light sensor and accelerometer) require some light soldering.

This is the list of hardware you will need for the kids workshop. Also, some of the components (like the sensors) require some light soldering.  

-   Raspberry Pi 3 or higher
-   Raspberry Pi Touch Display [https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/)
-   Micro USB power adapter for display (will also power the Raspberry Pi): [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995)  
    
-   USB cable to power Raspberry Pi off the display:  
    

-   Micro USB if you are using a Pi 3: [https://www.amazon.com/ZiBay-7-Inch-Samsung-Motorola-Android/dp/B01FSYBQ9Q/](https://www.amazon.com/ZiBay-7-Inch-Samsung-Motorola-Android/dp/B01FSYBQ9Q/)
-   USB-C if you are using a Pi 4/5: [https://www.amazon.com/JXMOX-Charging-Compatible-Samsung-Charger/dp/B0C4NJYPTX/](https://www.amazon.com/JXMOX-Charging-Compatible-Samsung-Charger/dp/B0C4NJYPTX/)  
    

-   Breadboard [https://www.adafruit.com/product/239](https://www.adafruit.com/product/239)
-   Pi T-Cobbler [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1989](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1989) (the diagrams I have are for a non-T cobbler, so they will need some updates)

-   Light Sensor [TSL2591] [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1980](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1980) (code was written for TSL2561 - will require some updates; pinouts are different so the diagram needs to be updated)  
    
-   Accelerometer [ADXL345] [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1231](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1231) (identical chip, but pinouts are different so the diagram needs to be updated)  
    
-   Keyboard - Any USB keyboard will work.
